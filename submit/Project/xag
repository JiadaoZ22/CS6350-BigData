The gas prices have sky rocketed, some of the long term staff is gone, lottery is gone, they have run out of popular cigarettes, I tried to get gas a few days ago and the vendors \/ delivery trucks that used to park on the side street or off to the side were parked at the pumps...I am going to give it a little time and see if it gets better.  I have been going to this store for 15+ years, but if it doesn't shape up, I will find another....","date":"2016-06-22 21:45:13"}

They didn't make it to 5 stars due to the prices are a bit high for the amount of food and the location is a bit unsavory. \nThe decor and atmosphere was surprisingly nice, from the outside I expected to be more run down inside. The staff was very nice. We were surprised how empty the dining room was for a Friday evening.\nWe got Vegetable Samosas to start then ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Rogan Josh, rice and plain Naan. Our only complaint was the lamb could've been more tender but everything was flavorful and delicious. \nI would definitely go again if given the chance.","date":"2016-07-25 03:55:20"}

I had never heard of it until that fateful St. Patricks day when another beer was in order.  After making my way there and enjoying the patio, I decided the food was my next venture.\n\nAfter my second, alcohol only, visit, I was excited to taste what vegetarian options they had.  I had the grilled cheese with spicy asparagus and portobello.  Let me tell you...grilled cheese is amazing, add a few interesting touches, it becomes addicting.  I was very happy with my sandwich.  Also, they have a very tasty appetizer of Goat Cheese Fritters with a red wine sauce.  Goat Cheese is one of my favorites and frying anything makes it better. I was in love.  \nTher service is great and they can accomadate large groups, the few times I've been has been with 7-20 people.  Great staff, awesome menu choices, I'll be going back","date":"2012-04-28 13:35:52"}

I've spent over $10.000 at their store over the years and have been a long time customer .. Bill the owners son was so rude to me and did nothing to resolve my broken machine. I was disgusted when Bill the owners daughter wouldn't do Any thing to help me when the repair man broke my machine. It's terrible to bring a nice sewing machine in to be repaired and these people broke it while in their possession and they don't want to do a damm thing about it. It was like a big (screw you) to me. I won't buy another thing from these people for the way I was treated. Even the material is too over priced. I'm in the market for another machine but I won't go there ever again. My machine STILL NEEDS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF AND THEY STILL HAVE NOT RESOLVED THIS ISSUE. ITS STILL BROKEN AND IT HAPPENED WHILE REPAIRMAN WAS SERVICING MY MACHINE. I WISH I HAD NEVER TAKEN MY MACHINE TO 35TH AVE SEW AND VAC SHOP. WHY CANT PEOPLE OWN UP TO TAKE OWNERSHIP TO THEIR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN MISTAKES!!!! GO TO KINGS SEWING MACHINES MUCH BETTER SERVICE AND THEY DONT BREAK YOUR MACHINE!!!!!","date":"2017-01-27 19:15:36"}

Sometimes the staff is personable and attentive. Other times I ask myself, \"Why do I come here???\" The staff often has the  \"GTFOH\" stamp placed permanently across their foreheads, and we as patrons just have to go with it, otherwise we are deemed \"that guy.\"  I would say that my continuos visits were for the great HH, but there are several other options close to home, with the same food and drink options for me to choose from.

I heard the food was good and it was and my waitress ( Dawn ) was also good ( even with it being very busy ). The problem I have is some of the waitress staff are rude. I had a gift card\/ certificate to pay for dinner. After a few minutes, a big blond waitress came over and said  ( in a loud and rude tone ) I couldn't use it cause I needed to spend $100.00 in order to get $50.00 off. She then insulted me by saying (so the tables around me could hear ) couldn't I read the fine print telling me of requirements to use gift card. I showed her the certificate and the fine print was not legible She told me, sorry that's not our fault it's yours and she walked away. I am having second thoughts about going back to use gift card. I may give it away or toss it out.","date":"2014-12-17 19:34:47"}
