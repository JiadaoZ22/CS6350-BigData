For the price we paid, I really would have liked a nice cut of meat. \n#2. Way over priced. Dinner for 2 with (2) blue moon beers and (1) $10 glass of wine... $165+tip. We tipped over 25% because our server was great and the experience of eating in the Dark was a pretty interesting experience. \n#3. The food was Meh... I would have been okay with everything else if the food was outstanding. It really wasn't... I probably ate 3 bites of my dinner entree just to taste what the different Ingredients were... It was far from savory and could have used even a pasta or something. A couple of dry (what tasted like hush puppies)?? I would have been impressed a little if when I told the server that I didn't enjoy it if he would have offered to try one of the others, but I didn't make a big deal because like I said before he was really nice. The dessert was literally the only saving grace. \nAll in all I gave a 2 star... (server and experience in the dark)... I just have to be honest incase others go in expecting a non-vegetarian meal... Be ready for a $200 vegetarian dinner!!!!\n*** also if they don't like your review on their Facebook page they will block you from commenting on other people talking crap about you, they can not handle the truth and allow others to put you down ***","date":"2017-12-02 18:35:23"}

By far my favorite restaurant in downtown Phoenix. I have tried so many different things from the menu and it never disappoints, but the Saturday night special Prime Rib and Horseradish Dauphinoise Potato is my favorite. Second, the service is amazing. Ian is my favorite waiter, will request him every time! He is so personable with a good sense of humor! He constantly is checking up to make sure everything is good (but not too much). He made the experience at the Arrogant Butcher memorable!","date":"2017-04-30 05:32:05"}

Unqualified servers who don't tell you that they won't take cash - and they seriously won't take cash.  Then the manager wouldn't even take the cash to another register. The lines are stupid \nlong and the workers incapable of handling the slightest issue. I m sitting upstairs if there is a next time I come to a Knights game.","date":"2018-09-25 03:58:48"}

We sat outside on the patio and watched the Food Channel and listened to music while going over the menu and having a great conversation with out out-of-country guests. The patio is a good place for kids because the patio can drown out even the loudest child.  If you have a need for food with a great bite to it, this is the spot. We only waited 20 minutes for a table for 8 at the peak dinner hour of 7-8. Our server was quick to greet us and get our drinks to our table. We ordered the sashimi wonton tacos and sausage cheese dip with pretzels wrapped with pepperoni. Tuna was fresh. Wontons not greasy. Wasabi sauce with enough zing but not enough to over power the tuna. Pretzels and cheese dip was nice and hot. Pretzels sprinkled with parmesan cheese and crisp.  Entree's were big enough to serve two people! Beef brisket, beef short ribs, pork ribs, Caesar salad, bacon cheese burger all packed with flavor. Caesar salad comes with a huge garlic crouton, which my daughter cut up and we used it to finish up the sausage cheese dip! Caesar dressing was fresh. Corn bread and macaroni & cheese sides tasty. Ordered the cheesecake for dessert. It was large enough for our party of 8 and we left some of it there. Asked our server to put the pretzels, fudge sauce and potato chips on the side instead of on top, which they did.   If your stomach is sensitive, you may want to ask for the various sauces on the side because this isn't a place to miss. It's not that the food is spicy, it does the dance of the happy on your tongue and in your tummy. For some people, it may be too much but for me, this is a good thing!","date":"2015-03-06 07:24:15"}

The food wasn't very good, way too greasy. My fries were luke warm and my tray was literally covered in grease. I needed about 50 napkins and a shower after that. The service was pretty awful too. I can't believe I paid $14 for a small meal with no extra fixings. On national cheeseburger day of all days too. Such a disappointment and I've never gone back since. Best thing about it was the soda, but that's pretty difficult to mess up.","date":"2015-07-28 09:33:12"}

After previously being told by another employee a week prior to get there at 6:01PM to get one of the six extra systems that weren't pre-ordered, and that it was first come first serve, I ended up not able to get a system. When I came in yesterday, the woman behind the counter told me they had written down names and numbers of people who wanted one a few days prior, and that they all were accounted for. \n\nThe previous employee even told me I was the first person to have asked about it. If they were organized, and told ALL their employees customers could put their names down on a PSVR, I could have gotten a system last night.\n\nNot only did this illiminate my chances of getting a system at GameStop, but made it too late for me to go to other department stores who had stock (as they were too far away, and lines were already forming at each location). \n\nNot happy.","date":"2016-10-13 20:59:22"}
