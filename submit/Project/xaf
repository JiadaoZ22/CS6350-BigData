I was with 2 other females...we had on dresses and heels. The place was very diverse as far as how everyone was dressed. Dresses, heels, jeans, flip flops, shorts, etc. Immediately we noticed large groups of people of a particular race coming from the back of the line and going inside. We thought nothing of it...assumed they were all on lists. Then it just got weird. We noticed the guy working the door was walking back and fourth scanning the line for people he would pull out and let go inside. Every time it just happened to be groups with Caucasian people. 4 Caucasian girls were in front of us and behind a group of 4 black males. The girls were pulled out of the line and taken to the door to go inside, no talk of any lists. The guys were told they must be on a list or leave. The guys left. We watched this happen quite a few more times before we just gave up here and removed ourselves from the line. We were standing in the front for a really long time with no acknowledgement from the guy working the door. Funny thing is he didn't make a big announcement that we must be on a list to get inside. He was walking up to particular groups and telling them in a low tone so they would leave. I know it wasn't because of how we were dressed or looked....they were letting people in with jeans and flip flops. Ultimately we were let in by a bouncer at a side door. There was nothing so special going on in there that they had to be \"picky\" about who they let inside. It was like a night at Suite.  Safe to say, I will never step foot in this place again.","date":"2014-07-13 16:17:18"}

The bubble tea here is really good. It's pricier than the one in Rose tea, but you also get more. \nI like that noodles with pork sauce. I've tried both the thin and wide\/thick noodles. The wide one is less chewy and are kind of sticky. I prefer the thin one for this dish.\nDan dan noodles are different from what I was expecting. My friend liked it but it's just okay for me.\nThe noodle with wonton is flavorless to me. \nThe soup dumplings are good but not amazing. If you've never had it before, give it a try and you probably will like it.\nI'd like to try noodles with beef soup next time.\n\nThe appetizers are too pricy in my opinion. I won't pay $6 for a small plate of vegetables again...\n\nThe owner is a nice guy and I enjoyed chatting with him a little bit during dinners.","date":"2013-05-07 03:29:21"}

We had a 2-1 coupon. Price was $37 for two people so a good deal. \n\nVery large space, open layout.  Been here a few times years ago. I ate mostly the crab legs. Prime rib. \n\nThey provide a self serve drink area, which I think is good.  You don't have to flag down a staff to get a drink when you want one. We've all been in that situation. \n\nUnlimited alcohol, wines and beer. They have a bar area with one bartender working and a bunch of tv's to watch or get updates on games. \n\nI wouldn't go out of my way, but if I was in Mirage and hungry, I'd eat there if we had another 2-1 coupon. I wouldn't spend full retail price eating there. Other buffets on the strip are better for same price points.","date":"2014-09-09 19:15:26"}

Going over the bridge, coming from Aliante Casino, you cant miss the nice view of the waterfall that is at the forefront of the park.\n\nToo bad this and the playground were the only nice things I can vouch for. \n\nThe playground is a nice fenced in little area that has a decent amount of playground equipment, swings, slides, tables, and benches. I like the soft material they use that the playground equipment is built on. There is also a sand lot area that has dinosaur bones as props. The day we went, the playground was packed. Kids were running into each other as they went down the slides. There were kids actually waiting to get on the swings! \n\nAfter a while we decided to walk around to check out the rest of the park. We see ducks everywhere especially in the pond that has the nice waterfall going into it. Unfortunately, this is where the \"nice stuff\" ends. Everywhere on the paths we were walking on were green duck crap. Which brings the question, \"Is there some kind of spray or force field they have on the playground?\" Because there were no ducks or green duck crap anywhere in the playground. Im also curious as to how many people would actually spread out a blanket and have a picnic on the grass for the crap was all over that as well. Just doing this review im starting to get grossed out thinking about that day.\n\nAfter carefully trying not to step on any crap going to the car, I made a mental note to make sure to mention all the green crap I saw in this review and to not hesitate in mentioning it to everybody I know that is either making plans on coming here or are just thinking about it. The only thing positive I can think of about that is to come here if you are on a diet. After seeing all the green crap, you probably wont be having much of an appetite and you definitely will get some exercise trying to avoid stepping on the stuff. \n\nSo, yeah, im not worried about coming back to this place any time soon in this lifetime. (You think?). Lol. Maybe as a duck.","date":"2013-05-28 21:06:57"}

Do the big name brands provide this? Yes, bit not at the same level Paul's Ace Hardware does in Tempe. If I need help, they are ready and willing to help me in every aspect of my project.\n\nThe store manager Bras personally went out if his way to assist me in gathering all the materials I needed for my current project. He knows his store, bounced around to show me all options, and seemed to have recommendations on each project. This guy must love what he does because he knows everything in the store (or he is a constant do-it-yourselfer).\n\nI am always pleased with the help I receive and am thankful this place is in my neighborhood.","date":"2014-01-17 02:08:15"}

But definitely sit outside if you can grab a seat. Luckily the patio was vacant that late afternoon.\n\nToppings - They Spicy Cajun Burger - Avocado, jalapeños, lettuce,\nJalapeño havarti, tomatoes, Cajun spice & Smokey chipotle & honey mayo. There was ample toppings on the burger, I enjoyed the avocado on my burger, overall not too spicy but good kick from the sliced jalapeños.\n\nMeat - Grilled perfectly, tasted average, but I found it too small compared to the bun.\n\nBun - Very soft, tasted good, but didn't hold up against the burger and all the toppings and at the end I was left with lots of bun and no more burger.\n\nBeer Battered Onion Rings - Very thick batter on these rings, golden brown, crunchy, very filling.\n\nDrink -Jones Strawberry-Lime Soda - Yummy not sour but good balance,\n\nOverall prompt friendly service, quaint little patio, average burger but good for a quick fix in satisfying the burger craving.","date":"2011-09-25 18:10:04"}
