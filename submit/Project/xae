This is definitely a great place to go if you are craving something smokey and delicious. \n\nI actually noticed this place because I wandered by when I was walking downtown and it's impossible to miss that lovely smokey\/BBQ smell if you're on the block. However, it looks kind of like a hole in the wall. The entrance doesn't look like it's been updated in years, and that's ok because it just adds character. The entire decor is wood\/country (to include buffalo head on the wall) and there is also a downstairs where there is live music on the weekends.\n\nOk onto the food. I have been here a couple of times now, so I think I can comment on the menu pretty well. My friends and I have ordered the brisket, the catfish, the veggie burger, the mac n cheese, the cesar salad, the chili, and the garlic fries. If I had to review this place based on the delicious and garliciness of their fries, this would be a 5-star review hands down. I mean, seriously, vampires beware, but everyone else should enjoy a-plenty.\n\nThe portion sizes are huge, so go hungry or be prepared for a to-go box (granted every time I've gone I have loved the food so much that I ate the entire meal.) \n\nI bet at this point in time you are wondering why I am only giving this place 4 stars then? Well, not everything is as amazing as those garlic fries. The bourbon apples are fairly tasteless, the chili is ok (the meat was very tough), and the service is also just ok. However, the catfish is delightful, the mac and cheese is also delicious, and the brisket is quality. \n\nThe specialty cocktails are also pretty good, and the beer prices are pretty decent. This is a great place to go for a long lunch, after dinner drink, or even a weekend brunch. There are vegetarian options on the menu (if you can ignore the buffalo head on the wall) and I believe even a few gluten-free options as well. It's a fairly good place to go with a large group, just make sure to call ahead. \n\nAll in all, like I said earlier, a great place for good times and smokey flavor.","date":"2014-10-27 04:22:34"}

I get invited out to eat frozen yogurt at Piccadilly.  A rare opportunity to truly compare the two yogurt places.\n\nHere, I tried three flavors - chocolate, pumpkin, and caramel sea salt.  Added toppings of brownie bits, chocolate caramel turtles, and mochi.\n\nOverall, I liked the yogurt better at Kiwispoon. The frozen yogurt seems less rich in Piccadilly's and the flavors are not as strong.  The price per ounce is also marginally higher at Piccadilly's.\n\nThere are definitely pluses to Piccadilly's yogurt though.  I liked the toppings better - I thought the mochi tasted better, the brownie pieces were bigger, and the chocolate caramel turtles went great on ice cream.  The chocolate caramel turtles should be a standard topping for both frozen yogurt and ice cream places.  Also, with the huge map of Cleveland Heights behind the cash register, this feels more like an authentic \"neighborhood\" froyo joint.","date":"2013-11-14 04:55:17"}

Everything was delicious, esp the pork belly banh mi. It's tender and juicy and the baguette was nicely toasted. Love the crispy fish taco too. Their compliment chips and salsa were fresh and super good and crispy. Service was excellent. Our waitress did a great job checking up on us and serving us. I really want other food options too but I'm too full. Next time i visit i will definitely come back.","date":"2018-05-28 20:56:05"}

The service was OK. Our server was great but kind of forgot about us towards the end of our visit. The food was cold. The only good thing there was the crab legs because they're suppose to be cold and the tacos because it was freshly made. The food was under a single lamp that didn't heat the food at all. We let the server know that the food was cold and he told the manager that was in charge. All she did was come over to ask what the problem was and said she was going to talk to the chief. Have no idea what actually happened though because we didn't see her after that. Half the buffet was closed as well so there wasn't that many options. I must say i rather go to the Rio buffet. For a high end casino this was a horrible experience.","date":"2013-12-07 00:14:06"}

You must try their cookies.  I got so lucky and grabbed some white chocolate macadamia cookies when they were still warm.  Crispy on the sides and chewy and mouth-wateringly good.  I mean, I was stuffed beyond belief, but I couldn't stop eating it!\n- If you get in during breakfast time, do try the Portuguese sausage.  It's the only breakfast food really worth it.\n\nAvoid:\n- Gelato bar looks good, but the texture was more like the soft serve at Dairy Queen. (which I HATE) So disappointed.\n- Shrimp pad thai was served ice cold.  So gross.","date":"2010-01-08 04:28:23"}
